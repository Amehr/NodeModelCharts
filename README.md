## Current Nodes
- Pie Chart
- Bar Chart
- Index-Value Line Plot
- XY Line Plot
- Scatter Plot
- Heat Map Plot

## Exporting Images
All `NodeModelChart` nodes have some additional options in their context menus (right-click on node), one of which is `Export Chart as Image`.  This option will export a Png image of the chart in the current size and state (excluding the `NodeView`).  For higher quality images, simply resize the node by dragging the box in the lower right-hand corner and export again.
